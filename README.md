# super-smash-brogp

Sends and retrieves BGP prefixes for fun.

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to stress test a BGP implementation. Maybe you are testing a new feature, vendor or ASIC. This tool will allow you to test if the code is stable, if convergence is fast, if the feature works, if there are memory leaks, etc.

##Installation

To install super-smash-brogp just clone the repo and install the dependancies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

The tool is meant to be run inside [exabgp](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp). There is not much purpose of using the tool in the CLI unless you want to see what it does.

### exabgp

Configure exabgp in any way you want. Just make sure you configure the process stanza to use ssbgp.py correctly, i.e.:

    group v4 {
        capability {
            asn4 enable;
            route-refresh enable;
            graceful-restart 60;
        }

        family {
            ipv4 unicast;
        }

        neighbor 192.168.232.0 {
            process p1_v4 {
                run ../../ssbgp.py 192.168.232.0 65001 config_files/ssbgp/v4_conf.yaml;
            }
            local-address 192.168.232.1;
            peer-as 4290030000;
            local-as 65001;
            router-id 192.168.232.1;

            graceful-restart;
            group-updates;
        }
    }

### CLI

To run the tool in the CLI without using exabgp:

    # ./ssbgp.py -h
    usage: ssbgp.py [-h] peer local_as conf

    Sends and retrieves BGP prefixes for fun.

    positional arguments:
      peer        Peer's IP address.
      local_as    Our own AS.
      conf        Path to configuration file.

### Example

Here you can see the result of running 4 ssbgp processes against a router:

    lab# show ip bgp sum
    BGP summary information for VRF default
    Router identifier 192.168.232.0, local AS number 65000
    Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance

## Configuration

### ssbgp

You also have to configure ssbgp. You can tweak some parameters like how many prefixes you want to add/remove on each iteration, how fast, from which file you want to read the prefixes, etc... You can find some examples in '''config_files/ssbgp/'''.

### exabgp

The tool leverages on exabgp, so the first thing you have to do is configure it to establish the peering sessions with your device. You have to make sure that you call the process that will start advertising and removing prefixes. You can find an example on how to configure exabgp and call the process in '''config_files/exabgp/exabgp.conf'''.
